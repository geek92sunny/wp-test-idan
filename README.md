# WP Test
## _This is the WP test by Sunny to Idan_

This is a complete WP project, so you will need to clone it to the root of the fresh WP installation.

After cloning it, install the dependecies from the **root** of the theme:

`composer install`

Then:
- Theme has a 'Home' template for the home page, you will need to choose that on the home page.
- You will need to choose cover and enter footer quotes from 'Theme Options' settings under admin.
