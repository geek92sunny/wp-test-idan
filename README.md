# WP Test
## _This is the WP test by Sunny to Idan_

This is a complete WP project, so you will need to clone it to the root of the fresh WP installation.

After cloning it, install the dependecies from the **root** of the theme:

`composer install`

Then:
- Theme has a 'Home' template for the home page, you will need to choose that on the home page.
- You will need to choose cover and enter footer quotes from 'Theme Options' settings under admin.

This is how it should look after populating data:
Home page: ![home Page](https://i.ibb.co/Wp7wYsc/image.png)

Single page: ![Single Page](https://i.ibb.co/ZdPCtc9/image.png)

## Few Notes / known issues:
1. The theme does not have all standard templates of WP hiearachy.
2. Theme is not mobile friendly.
3. I have developed and checked theme only on the Firefox.
